                            Since acquiring her Interior Design degree in 2015, Stef has moved from the world of corporate design working with big labels to freelance design working with small time business owners and families building their own homes. Her degree in Fine Arts prepared her to seamlessly incorporate form with function, art and aesthetic.

                        <p>
                            Stef now uses her Interior Design degree as an advantage in selling real estate. 3 years working in Ayala Land Premier exposed her to not only a wide range of clientele but also enhancing her skills in sales and marketing.

                            Stef is in charge of designing the NFTs while also look for artists to list with NFReal. Her work searching for artists to partner with the company is effectively very similar to her degree and working in real estate: it is about making connections and investments that can last a lifetime.
