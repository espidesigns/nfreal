                            This limited edition Eraserheads signed Vinyl record is one of 2500 made.

                            This record is even more collectible due to the autograph of frontman and Philippine musical icon Ely Buendia. The original album, released in 1993, was certified sextuple platinum and has been the source of ground-breaking and presently relevant songs arguably unmatched in Philippine OPM history.
