                                            NFReal offers two services. First is a method for selling valuable real items using NFTs. Second is an online and offline database using NFTs in order to provide centralized authentication records over artwork and valuable items.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In both services, the NFT is a companion to the real asset and will exist for as long as the real asset exists. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">
                                            NFReal serves as both a useful repository of records, and an online auction house using NFTs that seeks to give sellers an avenue to sell their valuable items at the best possible price while providing buyers maximum, concrete, and real-world value even while having participation in the digital world.
                                        </p>

                                            NFReal will mint a good-looking NFT for you that will include a document in the same NFT that has pertinent details of the painting, sculpture, collectible, sports memorabilia, or any valuable asset that you wish to sell. The NFT will contain previous owner and price history, a virtual certificate of authenticity, and other relevant details (as may be applicable to the kind of asset). We will sell your asset at auction at the maximum price less our fees, taxes, and storage/delivery/insurance charges, but at no time less than your agreed upon strike price.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">
                                            If you are selling using other platforms or galleries, we can help with providing a reliable centralized database that will be a repository of documents such as a certificate of authenticity, certificate of title or the equivalent, and can update the details from time to time.

                                            Unlike traditional crypto and NFTs, we will ask all of our members to submit one valid ID and fill up a KYC form. We will then validate the identity of the member. Moreover, we will give the seller the option to not pick the highest bidder. However, he must pick from the three highest bidders. We believe that some high value items are personal to the seller, and we want to give the seller the option to scrutinize the prospective buyers. There are two caveats to this ability to choose. One, the seller will have limited information about the buyer, and two, the seller must pick from the three highest bids.
                                        </p>                           
                                        <p>
                                            We will also manually record all information and transactions in an offline database that will be updated from time to time as ownership passes from one member to another. Any information in the blockchain shall be stored in the offline database. In the unlikely event of a hack or any untoward online event, we shall restore the NFT and any records online from our offline database. This will come in handy in the next iteration of NFReal, which will include its own currency to use within the NFReal system.

Depending on the appetite of the seller, even real property and vehicles can be sold and recorded in the NFReal.

If you are a buyer, will open your digital wallet for you and have the NFT transferred there. We will facilitate the transfer of the NFT to the buyer’s wallet.

While we believe most to all of the buyers will want the real asset in their possession, subject to a storage fee, the real asset may be stored for an owner. The owner can possibly resell the NFT-asset provided that the transaction passes through the NFReal system, subject to terms and conditions.
